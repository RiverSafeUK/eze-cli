# Small node scripts for maintenance

Selection of small scripts for maintence of license data

## Creation of supplement JSON

```javascript
spdxSupplementedData = {
    licensesPatterns: {
    },
    licenses: _.keyBy(_.sort(_.map(spdxData.licenses, (license) => { return {
        id: license.licenseId,
        name: license.name,
        type: '',
        isProfessional: '',
        isOsiApproved: license.isOsiApproved,
        isFsfLibre: license.isFsfLibre,
        isDeprecated: license.isDeprecatedLicenseId,
        reference: license.reference,
    }}), 'id'), 'id')
}
```

## Add new licenses to supplement JSON

SPDX data from https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/tree/master/json

```javascript
_.each(spdxData, (license, key) => {
    let org = spdxData.licenses[key]
    if(!org) {
        spdxSupplementedData.licenses[key] = license
        console.log(`new licence '${key}'`)
    }
})
```

## Key sorting if disrupted

```javascript
licenses = {}
_.each(spdxSupplementedData.licenses, (license, key) => {
licenses[key] = {}
licenses[key].id = license.id
licenses[key].name = license.name
licenses[key].type = license.type
licenses[key].isProfessional = license.isProfessional
licenses[key].isOsiApproved = license.isOsiApproved
licenses[key].isFsfLibre = license.isFsfLibre
licenses[key].isDeprecated = license.isDeprecated
licenses[key].reference = license.reference
})
JSON.stringify(licenses, null, '  ')
```
