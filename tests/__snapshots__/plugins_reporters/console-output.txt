    [safety] Vulnerabilities
    _________________________________
        [MEDIUM DEPENDANCY] : dependancy-pip-medium-with-cve (1.3.0)
        overview: The mirroring support (-M, --use-mirrors) in Python Pip before 1.5 uses insecure DNS querying and authenticity checks which allows attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.
        CVE: CVE-2013-5123
        recommendation: Update pip (1.3.0), vulnerable versions: <1.5

        [NA DEPENDANCY] : dependancy-na-pip-no-cve (1.3.0)
        overview: The pip package before 19.2 for Python allows Directory Traversal when a URL is given in an install command, because a Content-Disposition header can have ../ in a filename, as demonstrated by overwriting the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file. This occurs in _download_http_url in _internal/download.py.
        recommendation: Update pip (1.3.0), vulnerable versions: <19.2
