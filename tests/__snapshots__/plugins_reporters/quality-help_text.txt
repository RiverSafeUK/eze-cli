Note: this reporter is used to "threshold" the results, and throw a Application error
when a said threshold is exceeded (aka ala unit test suite)

This reporter is extremely versatile and designed to allow developers to set custom
threshold to match their environment needs

#
# Use case 1
# =====================
# Will exit when total number of vulnerabilities in all tools over VULNERABILITY_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD exceeds VULNERABILITY_COUNT_THRESHOLD

# [Optional] defaults to 0
VULNERABILITY_COUNT_THRESHOLD = 0

# [Optional] defaults to "medium"
VULNERABILITY_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD = "xxx"

#
# Use case 2
# =====================
# Set Explicit limits for each type of vulnerability

# [Optional] Will when errors of type over limit, not set by default
VULNERABILITY_CRITICAL_SEVERITY_LIMIT = xxx
VULNERABILITY_HIGH_SEVERITY_LIMIT = xxx
VULNERABILITY_MEDIUM_SEVERITY_LIMIT = xxx
VULNERABILITY_LOW_SEVERITY_LIMIT = xxx
VULNERABILITY_NONE_SEVERITY_LIMIT = xxx
VULNERABILITY_NA_SEVERITY_LIMIT = xxx
