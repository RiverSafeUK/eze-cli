Common Gotchas
===========================
NPM Installing

A bill-of-material such as CycloneDX expects exact version numbers. 
Therefore the dependencies in node_modules needs installed

This can be accomplished via:

$ npm install

This will be ran automatically, if npm install fails this tool can't be run
