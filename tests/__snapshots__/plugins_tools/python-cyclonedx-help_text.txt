install_help:
======================
In most cases all that is required is python and pip (version 3+), and cyclonedx installed via pip

pip install cyclonedx-bom

Common Gotchas
===========================
Pip Freezing

A bill-of-material such as CycloneDX expects exact version numbers. Therefore requirements.txt must be frozen. 

This can be accomplished via:

$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
